            <p>The solar system consists of the sun and everything that orbits the sun. This includes the eight planets and their moons, the dwarf planets, asteroids, comets and other small objects.
            </p>

            <p> All the planets and dwarf planets, the rocky asteroids, and the icy bodies in the Kuiper belt move around the Sun in elliptical orbits in the same direction that the Sun rotates. This motion is termed prograde, or direct, motion.
